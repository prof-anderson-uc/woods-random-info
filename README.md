# Display Random Information with JavaScript

This script is similar to the code we used to display a random image. The biggest difference is that the random image script was activated automatically when the page loads, but this script doesn't activate until you click a button. 

This is done by creating a **function** that will be activated by an **event**. 

## Functions
A function is a bit of code to perform a task that doesn't run until you call it's name. A function is a bit like a variable, but it contains *logic*, in that it will wait until referenced before processing the code inside of it. 

Functions share a common syntax. The function name is always immediately followed by `()` and then curly brackets that contain the additional information used by the function. The `()` can sometimes contain additional information, called a "argument", that can be used by the function. However, more often than not the parenthesis will be left empty. 

## Events
JavaScript is always listening in the background, watching your page for things to happen. An **event** is an action that can be detected by JavaScript, such as when the page loads or when a user clicks on an object. A script can tied to an event on a page, not activating until that event occurs. 

In scripts, an event is identified by an **event handler**. Some common event handlers include `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, and `onkeydown`. 

<!-- 1. Create an array that contains information
2. 

`innerHTML` - this is a simple method for accessing/changing/adding content to an element. 


`function showInfo()`

`var infoList`

`var randomItem`  -->
